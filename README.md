This GitHub organization hosts the collective efforts, code, and resources for our team's participation in the **2025 EEG Foundation Challenge: From Cross-Task to Cross-Subject EEG Decoding**, accepted to the NeurIPS 2025 Competition Track.

## ðŸŽ¯ The Challenges

Our objective is to develop state-of-the-art models to tackle two distinct but related challenges in EEG decoding.

| Challenge                               | Final Score Weight | Goal                                                                        | Evaluation Metric          |
| --------------------------------------- | :----------------: | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| **1. Cross-Task Transfer Learning** |        `30%`         | Predict `response times` by transferring knowledge from passive to active tasks. | Normalized RMSE (`NRMSE`) |
| **2. Psychopathology Factor Prediction**|        `70%`         | Predict clinical `psychopathology factors` using subject-invariant representations. | Normalized RMSE (`NRMSE`) |

## ðŸ’» Our Repositories

This organization contains all codebases related to our project. Each repository serves a specific purpose as outlined below.

| Repository                                     | Description                                                                                             |
| ---------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **[Challenge1](https://github.com/NeurIPS-2025-EEG-Foundation-Challenge/Challenge1)** | A dedicated repository for developing and testing models specifically for `Challenge 1`. |
| **[Challenge2](https://github.com/NeurIPS-2025-EEG-Foundation-Challenge/Challenge2)** | A dedicated repository for developing and testing models specifically for `Challenge 2`. |
| **[startkit](https://github.com/NeurIPS-2025-EEG-Foundation-Challenge/startkit)** | A Jupyter Notebook version of the official starter kit, adapted and shared by `JM` for rapid prototyping and analysis. |
| **[Unified-NeurIPS-2025-EEG-Challenge](https://github.com/NeurIPS-2025-EEG-Foundation-Challenge/Unified-NeurIPS-2025-EEG-Challenge)** | The primary, unified repository integrating all final code, experiments, and submission logic for both challenges. |

## ðŸ§  Dataset Overview

* **Primary Data:** We are using the **Healthy Brain Network (HBN) EEG Dataset**, which includes recordings from over 3,000 participants across six distinct cognitive tasks.
* **Key Constraint:** As per the competition rules, all development and evaluation must be performed on the **100Hz downsampled** dataset. The official format is `BDF`.
* **Target Variables:**
    1.  **Response Time** for each trial in active tasks.
    2.  Four **Psychopathology Dimensions** (`p-factor`, `internalizing`, `externalizing`, `attention`).

## âœ… Competition Rules & Submission

A brief summary of the key rules:
- All evaluation will be performed on the **100Hz downsampled data**.
- Use of external datasets and pre-trained models is allowed but must be documented.
- This is a **code submission** competition.
- Final models must be runnable on a **single GPU with 20GB of VRAM** at the inference stage.
